# Weekly Spending Analyzer

## Overview
The Weekly Spending Analyzer is a Python-based financial tool designed to help users evaluate their weekly expenses and monitor spending behavior.

This project demonstrates core Python fundamentals including:
- User input handling
- Type conversion (int and float)
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Logical operators
- Budget evaluation logic

## Features
- Accepts weekly budget input
- Collects multiple expense entries
- Calculates total weekly spending
- Determines remaining balance
- Evaluates financial status (within budget, balanced, or over budget)
- Simulates multiple months to monitor financial behavior trends

## Technologies Used

## Financial Logic Applied
The program calculates:

Remaining Balance = Weekly Budget − Total Expenses

Based on the result:
- Positive → Within budget
- Zero → Balanced
- Negative → Over budget

## Purpose
This project was built to strengthen financial logic implementation using Python and simulate real-world budgeting scenarios.
